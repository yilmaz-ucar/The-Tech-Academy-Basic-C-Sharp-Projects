The first line of the program must be: “Welcome to Package Express. Please follow the instructions below.”

The user must then be prompted for the package weight.

If the weight is greater than 50, display the error message, “Package too heavy to be shipped via Package Express. Have a good day.” At this point the program would end.

The user must then be prompted for the package width.

Then the package height.

Then the package length.

If the dimensions total greater than 50, display the error message, “Package too big to be shipped via Package Express.” At this point the program would end.

Next, multiply the three dimensions (height, width, & length) together, and multiply the product by the weight. Finally, divide the outcome by 100.

The result of that calculation is the quote.

Display the quote to the user as a dollar amount.

For example: 

Welcome to Package Express. Please follow the instructions below.
Please enter the package weight:
40
Please enter the package width:
10
Please enter the package height:
 12
Please enter the package length:
 11
Your estimated total for shipping this package is: $528.00
